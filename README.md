# Fullstack Arts App

The **Fullstack Arts App** is a scalable platform designed to empower arts teachers to create and manage their own teaching businesses. The app is built to grow in stages, starting with a foundational CMS tool and a public-facing site, and evolving into a full-scale platform with advanced features.

## **Project Overview**

This project is designed to address the common struggles faced by arts teachers and small businesses, such as scheduling, dynamic form creation, and managing client interactions. The app is built with scalability in mind, allowing it to grow from a single-teacher business to a robust platform for multiple users.

### **Key Features (Planned and In Progress)**

1. **CMS Tool (Current Stage):**

   - A content management system for managing lessons, schedules, and client data.
   - Built with a focus on flexibility and scalability.

2. **Public Site (Current Stage):**

   - A static JSON-based public-facing site to showcase services and offerings.
   - Will eventually integrate with a backend for dynamic content.

3. **Dynamic Forms:**

   - Customizable forms for collecting client information and managing workflows.

4. **Scheduling System:**

   - Tools to simplify scheduling for teachers and clients.

5. **Admin and Client Roles:**

   - Role-based access control for administrators and clients.

6. **Client Portal (Future Stage):**

   - A dedicated portal for clients to view schedules, make payments, and interact with teachers.

7. **Payment API Integration (Future Stage):**

   - Integration with payment APIs (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for seamless transactions.

8. **Scalability:**
   - Designed to grow from a single-teacher business to a multi-user platform.
